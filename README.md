# Learning CSS

## Introduction to CSS

 - controls the style, formating of a webpage in an *external style sheet* that replaces a ```<style> tag```
    - now use a ```<link>``` tag instead, that can be put on any html file
 - allows you to seperate the content and presentation of webpage = **single responsibility principle**

 - Imma make a site using github pages!

 - the basic principle for your stylesheet is to selet an html element, and then apply a style to it
     ``` css
     body{
        background-color: blue;
    }
    ```
        - the "body" bit will select the body element in the html file to apply this to
        - the next line is called a **property-value pair**.
